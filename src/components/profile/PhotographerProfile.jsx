                    <p className='fs-5'><span className='text-dark fs-1'>Allan Zepeda</span> has spent nearly 20 years shooting private weddings and events worldwide. He believes that itâ€™s an honor witnessing and documenting the joining of two families and the emotions and traditions that go along with this occasion. His style and signature aesthetic has been described as timeless, natural, and romantic with understated elegance. He specializes in capturing genuine emotions and joyful moments â€” the photos that clients donâ€™t know to request and the ones that other photographers overlook. In addition, he specializes in documenting events with an editorial eye without disrupting the couple or taking them away from the experience of their wedding weekend.</p>
